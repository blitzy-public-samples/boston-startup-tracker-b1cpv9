# TODO: Implement scheduling for the crawlers to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly)
# This can be done by adding this script to crontab or using a task scheduler

# Human tasks:
# - Implement the logic to run the web crawlers, potentially using tools like Scrapy.
# - Set up scheduling for the crawlers to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
# - Implement logging to track the progress and results of the crawling process.
# - Add error handling and notifications for any issues encountered during crawling.
