# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Boston Startup Tracker is a comprehensive digital platform designed to provide real-time, enriched data on active venture-backed companies headquartered in Boston. This solution addresses the need for a centralized, up-to-date resource that offers insights into the vibrant Boston startup ecosystem. By aggregating and presenting crucial information from various public sources, the tracker will serve as an invaluable tool for investors, job seekers, researchers, and industry analysts.

## OBJECTIVES

1. Create a user-friendly database of Boston-based startups that have raised institutional funding within the past five years.
2. Aggregate and display key company information, including:
   - Company details (name, website, industry, sub-sector)
   - Funding information (total raised, last round, stage, investors)
   - Employee data (total count, local count, growth rate)
   - Leadership team (founders, executives)
   - Current hiring status and available roles
   - Recent news and developments
3. Implement automated data crawling and updating mechanisms to ensure information accuracy and timeliness.
4. Provide a platform for users to easily search, filter, and analyze Boston's startup landscape.
